Header:
0x00  | byte   | endian mode (0x11 for wii files)
0x01  | uint24 | decompressed file size
0x04  | end

Data:
stream of blocks immediately after the header
each chunk is 1 byte flags followed by 8 data chunks

flags determine which chunks are back-references to previous data
- read from the most significant bit
- if the bit is 1, that chunk is a back-reference
- if it is 0, that chunk is a raw byte

back-reference chunks are variable width depending on the length of the copy
the top 4 bits of the first byte choose the mode:

x >= 2:  small reference
  - x is the length (more precisely, length = x + 1, allowing for 3-16 bytes)
  - next 12 bits are the distance to go back from the current write pointer in the decoded data

x == 0:  medium reference
  - next 8 bits (y) are the length (length = y + 17, allowing 17-272 bytes)
  - next 12 bits are the distance

x == 1:  long reference
  - next 16 bits (z) are the length (length = z + 273, allowing 273-65808 bytes)
  - next 12 bits are the distance
